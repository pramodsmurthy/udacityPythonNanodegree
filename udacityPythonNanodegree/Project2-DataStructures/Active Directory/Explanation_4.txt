Data Structures:
	The current group's group list could be any number of groups. To recursively search for given user in 
	each of those groups, we can use recursion. 

Algorithm / Pseudocode:
	is_user_in_group(user, group):
		val = False
		for u in group.users:
			if u == user:
				return True
		
		for g in group.groups:
			val = is_user_in_group(user, g)
			if val:
				break
		return val

Time Complexity:
	Time taken is O(n), where n is the length of users in each of the current group's groups (and their groups and so on)
	                                 + length of users in current group
