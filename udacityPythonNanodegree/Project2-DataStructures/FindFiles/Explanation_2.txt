Data Structures:
	Since the problem statement is a case of finding same thing repeatedly, recursion is a good data structure to use.

Algorithm / Pseudocode:
	For each entry in the path:
		if path is empty:
			return the filelist
		else if path is a file:
			if file ends with given suffix:
				append to filelist
		else if path is a directory:
			for each entry in directory:
				add entry to pathslist
		
		if valid entry in pathslist:
			call_function_recursively(next_entry_in_pathslist)
			
Complexity:
	Since each entry is processed only once, complexity is O(n).
